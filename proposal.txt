Proposal: 

This project is inspired by an ongoing Kaggle image recognition challenge. 
Google has released datasets with substantial amount of images (labeled) 
containing various objects. The goal is to build a deep learning model 
trained and tuned by those images and would be able to recognize objects 
of similar kind (but never seen before). Our program needs to utilize that 
calibrated model to identify objects in a new image by cropping them into 
boxes.

Our project aims to, first, identify as many objects as possible from the 
background environment in a given image, and then, based on the features 
extracted from those croppings by the machine learning model, identify what 
that object is, e.g. flowers, cars, animals, etc (but we plan to start simple 
by restricting the complexity of the training set first, i.e. detect flower 
vs car only for the first iteration).

Several tools such as openCV, sklearn and so on, would be used for the 
completion of this project. Instead of running pages of code to produce 
graphs and statistical analysis, we will design a simple graphical user 
interface that simply asks for an input image and displays a list of 
cropped images for the labeled objects.
